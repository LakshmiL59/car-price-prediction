Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
Car price prediction is a popular application of machine learning, particularly in the automotive and finance sectors. It involves estimating the price of a car based on various attributes such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage,horse power, engine capacity, fuel type, and condition. Machine learning algorithms analyze historical data to understand patterns and relationships between these features and the car prices.

Workflow of Car Price Prediction:
Data Collection: Gather historical data from sources like online marketplaces or dealerships.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables (e.g., fuel type), and normalize numerical features (e.g., mileage).
Feature Selection: Select relevant attributes that influence car prices to reduce model complexity.
Model Training: Train machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting on the prepared dataset.
Model Evaluation: Validate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared to ensure accuracy.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict prices of new or unseen cars based on their attributes.
